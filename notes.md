My ramblings so I don't forget good ideas.

# Dynamics

Every field, no matter what, will have a "state" called `Dynamic`. This "state" allows
for statically trackable (resolvable) field states to be demoted to runtime tracked.
Additionally, unresolvable field states which necessarily are *not* statically tracked
**only** have the `Dynamic` state such that ownership rules are still enforced.

It wouldn't be good for different places to interact with hardware, unaware of the fact
that other places are interacting with the same hardware, so writes (or any operation
with implicative effects) will require `&mut some_field::Dynamic`.

Another benefit to requiring `Dynamic` references to perform operations on fields, is that
fields within transient peripherals cannot accidentally be interacted with as the `Dynamic`
instance is dispatched when unmasking the peripheral, necessarily meaning the peripheral
is present and ready for use.

Examples:

```rust
peripheral::register::modify(|_, w| w.foo(&old.foo).bar());
```
> Read or write requires `&Dynamic` to enforce ownership and peripheral availability.

```rust
// converting a resolved state into a dynamic is a noop
let dyn_foo = old.foo.into_dynamic();

// now foo can be used dynamically
peripheral::register::modify(|_, w| w.foo(&dyn_foo).bar());
```

```rust
peripheral::register::transition(|reg| reg.foo(dyn_foo).bar());
```
> Statically resolve a *resolvable* but currently dynamic field state.

## Implicative Effects

As it is now, reading or writing to a dynamic field requires `&mut Dynamic`. But,
if reading a field has no implicative effects, really only a `&Dynamic` is needed.
As it is now, proto-hal does not track nor express effects (yet). So I will leave
it as is in the interest of erring on the side of caution, but once effects are
tracked, the `&mut Dynamic` can be relaxed to `&Dynamic`.

# Field Traits

There are three situations where a field state constraint could be applied:
1. The bound for a state that pertains to a particular field.
1. The bound for a state to be trainsitioned from.
1. The bound for a state to be transitioned to.

1 is useful for the transition builder, requiring each generic to specifically be a state
for the corresponding field of that generic position.

2 implies 1, requires no additional implementation details, and is implemented for less
types. For example, 2 is not implemented for `Unresolved` but 1 is.

3 imples 1, requires transition related implementation details, and is implemented for
less types than 1, and only includes types from 2 which are resolvable. For example,
3 is not implemented for `Dynamic` but 2 is.

## Signatures

```rust
pub trait Position<T> {}
```

```rust
pub trait Outgoing<T> {}
```

```rust
pub trait Incoming<T> {
    type Raw;
    const RAW: Self::Raw;
}
```
